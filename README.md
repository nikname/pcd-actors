# pcd-actors

A mock system that abstract a simplified implementation of the [actor model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model). 
The system has to be considered as a mock because the main components are intentionally left abstract.

The system was intended as a personal solution to the project of the Java course at the University of Padova.
