# pcd-actors

A mock system that abstract a simplified implementation of the [actor model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model). 
The system has to be considered as a mock because the main components are intentionally left abstract.

The main abstract types of the system are the following:

 * `Actor`: this type represents an actor, which can receive a message and react accordingly
 * `Message`: the message actors can send each others. A message should contain a reference to the sender actor
 * `ActorRef`: a reference to an instance of an actor. Using this abstraction it is possible to treat in the same way
   local actors and actors that execute remotely
 * `ActorSystem`: an actor system provides the utilities to create new instances of actors and to locate them

The system was intended as a personal solution to the project of the Java course at the University of Padova.
